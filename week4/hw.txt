Write a function 

first_answer of type (’a -> ’b option) -> ’a list -> ’b 
(notice the 2 arguments are curried). 


The first argument should be applied 
to elements of the second argument in order 
until the first time it returns SOME v for some v and 
then v is the result of the call to first_answer. 

If the first argument returns NONE for all list elements, 
then first_answer should raise the exception NoAnswer. 

Hints: Sample solution is 5 lines and does nothing fancy.
