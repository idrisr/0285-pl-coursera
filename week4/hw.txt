Write a 
function check_pat that 

takes a pattern and 

returns true if and only if
all the variables appearing in the pattern are distinct from each other 

(i.e., use different strings). 

The constructor names are not relevant. 

Hints: 
The sample solution uses two helper functions. 

The first 
* takes a pattern and 
* returns a list of all the strings it uses for variables. 
* Using foldl with a function that uses @ is useful in one case. 

The second 
* takes a list of strings and 
* decides if it has repeats. 
* List.exists may be useful. 
* Sample solution is 15 lines. 

These are hints: We are not requiring foldl and List.exists here, but
they make it easier.
