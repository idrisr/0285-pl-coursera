4. Write functions 

longest_string_helper, 
longest_string3, and 
longest_string4 

such that:

• If longest_string_helper is passed a function that behaves like > (so it
returns true exactly when its first argument is stricly greater than its
second), then the function returned has the same behavior as longest_string1.

• longest_string_helper has type (int * int -> bool) -> string list -> string
(notice the currying). This function will look a lot like longest_string1 and
longest_string2 but is more general because it takes a function as an argument.

• longest_string3 has the same behavior as longest_string1 and longest_string4 has the
same behavior as longest_string2.


• longest_string3 and longest_string4 are defined with val-bindings and partial applications of longest_string_helper
