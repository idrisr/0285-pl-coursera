2. 

Write a function longest_string1 that takes a string list and returns the
longest string in the list. If the list is empty, return "". In the case of a
tie, return the string closest to the beginning of the list. Use foldl,
String.size, and no recursion (other than the implementation of foldl is
recursive).

3. 
Write a function longest_string2 that is exactly like longest_string1 except in
the case of ties it returns the string closest to the end of the list. Your
solution should be almost an exact copy of longest_string1. Still use foldl and
String.size
