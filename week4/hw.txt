1.  Write a function only_capitals that 

takes a string list and 
returns a string list 
    that has only the strings in the argument that start with an uppercase letter. 
    
Assume all strings have at least 1 character. 
Use 
List.filter,
Char.isUpper, and 
String.sub 

to make a 1-2 line solution.

2. Write a function longest_string1 that takes a string list and returns the longest string in the list. If the list is empty, return "". In the case of a tie, return the string closest to the beginning of the list. Use foldl, String.size, and no recursion (other than the implementation of foldl is recursive).
3. Write a function longest_string2 that is exactly like longest_string1 except in the case of ties it returns the string closest to the end of the list. Your solution should be almost an exact copy of longest_string1. Still use foldl and String.size
